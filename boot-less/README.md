# boot-less
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/deraen/boot-less/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/deraen/boot-less)

[Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) task to compile Less.

* Provides the `less` task
* For each `.main.less` in fileset creates equivalent `.css` file.
* Uses [Less4j](https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j) Java implementation of Less compiler through [less4clj clojure wrapper](https://github.com/Deraen/less4clj)
* For parallel leiningen plugin check [less-less4j](https://github.com/Deraen/lein-less4j/)
* For parallel [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) task check [boot-sass](https://github.com/Deraen/boot-sass)

## Usage

```clj
[s source-map  bool "Create source-map for compiled CSS."
 c compression bool "Compress compiled CSS using simple compression."]
```

To create css file `public/css/main.css` have the less file on path `public/css/main.main.less` or use sift task to move the css file:
`(comp (less) (sift :move {#"main.css" "public/css/main.css"}))`

## Features

- Load imports from classpath
  - Loading order. `@import "{name}";` at `{path}`.
    1. check if file `{path}/{name}.less` exists
    2. try `(io/resource "{name}.less")`
    3. try `(io/resource "{path}/{name}.less")`
    4. check if webjars asset map contains `{name}`
      - Resource `META-INF/resources/webjars/{package}/{version}/{path}` can be referred using `{package}/{path}`
      - E.g. `bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less` => `META-INF/resources/webjars/bootstrap/3.3.1/less/bootstrap.less`
  - You should be able to depend on `[org.webjars/bootstrap "3.3.1"]`
    and use `@import "bootstrap/less/bootstrap";`
  - Use boot debug to find what is being loaded:
    `boot -vvv less`

## FAQ

### Log configuration

If you don't have any slf4j implementations you will see a warning:

```
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```

To disable this add a no operation logger to your project. As this is only required
on build phase, you can use `:scope "test"` so that the dependency is not
transitive and is not included in uberjar.

```
[org.slf4j/slf4j-nop "1.7.13" :scope "test"]
```

If you are using slf4j logging it might be that a library used by
less4j will write lots of stuff to your log, then you should add the following
rule to your `logback.xml`:

```xml
  <logger name="org.apache.commons.beanutils.converters" level="INFO"/>
```
